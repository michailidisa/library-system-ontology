Presentation of the Library Model Ontology using OWL language


In this repository, we will represent the university library ontology model, but the ontology will be constructed in OWL and the Protege software. For the construction of the ontology, except for the remarks provided on the previous deliverable also some further classes and properties were inserted both for completion and representation reasons.
